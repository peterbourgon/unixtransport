# package unixproxy

> :warning: EXPERIMENTAL AND POTENTIALLY INSECURE

This package provides a reverse proxy to local Unix sockets. The intent is to
facilitate local development of distributed systems, by creating
semantically-meaningful addresses for an arbitrary number of HTTP servers on
localhost.

See [package documentation][docs] for details.
