# package unixproxy

<h3 align="center">:warning: &nbsp; EXPERIMENTAL AND POTENTIALLY INSECURE &nbsp; :warning:</h3>

This package provides a reverse proxy to local Unix sockets. The intent is to
facilitate local development of distributed systems, by creating
semantically-meaningful addresses for an arbitrary number of local processes.

See [package documentation][docs] for details.
